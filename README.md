# Overview

This project was inspired by my desire to develop my first iOS mobile application. 

This app takes in two user inputs, the user's hourly wage and the dollar price of any object. Then the _calculate_ button will trigger a calculation which will give the user the time price of said object. With this time price, the user will know exactly how much of his time that specific object is worth.

# Future Work

* Use the iPhone camera to scan a receipt or price tag and have the time price show in real time next to the dollar price.
* Allow the user to save a time price and store additional details about the object
